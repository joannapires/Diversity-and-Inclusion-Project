      <h3>Diversity and Inclusion in Everyday Spaces</h3>
      <p>
        Diversity and inclusion shape how people experience workplaces,
        classrooms, and communities. When individuals feel respected and valued,
        they are more likely to participate, contribute ideas, and succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website provides a simple introduction to diversity and inclusion,
        explaining key ideas and offering practical steps that anyone can take
        to help create more inclusive environments.

      <h4>What Do We Mean by Diversity and Inclusion?</h4>
      <p>
        Diversity refers to the presence of differences within a group of
        people. These differences can relate to identity, background,
        experiences, and ways of thinking. Some aspects of diversity, such as
        age or gender, may be visible, while others, such as education,
        neurodiversity, or socio-economic background, may not be immediately
        apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        In workplace and educational settings, diversity helps bring together a
        wider range of perspectives. When people with different experiences
        collaborate, they can approach problems more creatively and develop more
        effective solutions. Inclusion focuses on how people experience these
        environments. An inclusive environment is one where individuals feel
        comfortable expressing themselves, contributing ideas, and participating
        fully without fear of exclusion or discrimination.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to understand that diversity alone is not enough. A
        group may be diverse but still feel unwelcoming if inclusive practices
        are not in place. Inclusion ensures that diversity leads to positive
        outcomes rather than division.

                Diversity recognises that every individual brings unique
                qualities shaped by their background and experiences. Valuing
                diversity means acknowledging these differences rather than
                ignoring them and understanding how they contribute to richer
                learning and working environments.<br /><br />Diverse teams
                benefit from a wider range of viewpoints, which can lead to
                improved creativity, innovation, and decision-making.

              <p class="equity-text">
                Equity focuses on fairness and access. Rather than treating
                everyone exactly the same, equity recognises that individuals
                may face different challenges and barriers.<br /><br />By
                providing appropriate support—such as flexible working
                arrangements, accessible learning materials, or additional
                guidance—equity helps ensure that everyone has a fair
                opportunity to succeed.

                Inclusion is about creating environments where people feel
                respected, supported, and valued. Inclusive practices encourage
                participation, open communication, and mutual respect.<br /><br />An
                inclusive culture ensures that people do not feel pressured to
                hide aspects of their identity in order to fit in and that all
                voices are taken seriously.
